## Coding Style Guides

### Current Standards

1. **Swift Style Guide**  
   Our [Swift Style Guide](swift_style_guide.md) outlines the rules and best practices for writing clean, maintainable Swift code. It includes:
   - Naming conventions
   - Formatting rules
   - File structure
   - Error handling
   - Tools like SwiftLint for enforcement

---

## Tools

We use the following tools to maintain code quality and enforce standards:
- **[SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)**: Automatically checks for style guide violations.
- **Xcode**: Set up auto-formatting for indentation, braces, and more.
